# KanbanExtJS

Sample application for Kanban. I chose to use ExtJS to build this application.
I think this library is too heavy for the page I am going to build. But since this is my favorite framework,
I feel more comfortable to coding with it.

# Application Structure Introduction

## KanbanExtJS/app

This folder contains the JavaScript files for the application.

## KanbanExtJS/resources

This folder contains static resources (typically an `"images"` folder as well).

## KanbanExtJS/sass

This folder contains the styling for the application's views. See KanbanExtJS/sass/Readme.md
for details.

## KanbanExtJS/build

This folder contains the generated production code after build. All the code are compressed.

# Live Demo
Sencha cmd is used to making the production build for this website. All the JS files are compressed into one large app.js file
to improve the performance.
